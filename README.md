#<Website>

## Description

The previous page was working fine with no problem at all; however, when I checked the syntax of the HTML and the CSS file I found that it had overcomplicated syntax for the navigation bar, footer, and had overcomplicated syntax for them in the CSS as well. 

I build this project to simplify the syntax of the previous website so that it will be easier for the programmer to make changes in the webpage, as the programmer will understand the syntax more clearly.

It makes any changes in the website easier for the future.

I learned that in HTML and CSS, there not only one way to make a webpage, there are hundereds of different ways to make the website work in the same way.
