# The-Best-Refactor

## Description
 
- Nodody likes to look at a code then is overlly complicated, and is not semantic. So, I decided to refactor this webpage code, so that it will more semantic, easy to read, and is esay to modify in future.

- To achieve my goal, I read the whole code and decided to refactor it wherever needed and commented it, so that the viewer can understand it completely.
